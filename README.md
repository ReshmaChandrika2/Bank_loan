# Bank_loan

As part of a data analytics project, I developed an automated Bank Loan Reporting system using SQL to help provide clear, actionable insights into loan portfolios. By working with large datasets, I was able to streamline how loan performance, customer segmentation, and risk factors were analyzed.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in SQL and data management but also deepened my understanding of financial reporting. It gave me hands-on experience in making sense of complex data and turning it into meaningful reports that financial institutions can rely on for better decision-making.
